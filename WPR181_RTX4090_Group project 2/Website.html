        <h2 style="color: blue;"><i><u>Evolution of the internet.</u></i></h2>
        <p> 1969:
            The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense. Its primary purpose was to facilitate communication between researchers at various universities and government institutions.
             ARPANET laid the foundation for the internet by establishing the concept of packet switching, which enabled data to be transmitted in small packets across a distributed network.

          <br>
          <br>
            1971:         
           Ray Tomlinson, an engineer working on ARPANET, sent the first networked email. This invention marked a significant step forward in digital communication, enabling users to send messages electronically, a precursor to modern email systems.
            <br>
            <br>
           1970:        
            The development of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) by Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn was instrumental in creating a standardized method for data transmission across diverse networks. This innovation formed the 
            backbone of the modern internet, ensuring compatibility and interconnection among different networks.
           <br>
           <br>
            1990:            
            Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, introduced the World Wide Web (WWW), a system that allowed users to access and navigate between websites using hyperlinks. Berners-Lee's creation of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
            and the first web browser, WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus), revolutionized the way we access information on the internet.
            <br>
            <br>
            1993:       
            Mosaic, developed by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), was one of the earliest web browsers with a graphical user interface. It made the web more user-friendly and played a crucial 
            role in popularizing the World Wide Web.
